    "Let's see step by step what happens:\n",

    "1. `Agent_1` calls `get_service_description(is_supply)` to generate the service description. `is_supply` is a flag to \n",
    "switch between registering goods which the agent supplies (`is_supply` is `True`, the agent is in a seller role for these goods) \n",
    "and registering goods which the agent demands (`is_supply` is `False`, the agent is in a buyer role for these goods).\n",
    "2. `Agent_1` sends a `register_service` request to the OEF node, to register her services (the goods she supplies/demands) on the OEF.\n",
    "3. Analogous to (1), but for `Agent_2`\n",
    "4. Analogous to (2), but for `Agent_2`\n",

    "`is_searching_for_sellers` is a flag to switch between searching for sellers and searching for buyers of the goods referenced in the query. \n",
    "If the agent is searching for sellers than the agent is in the buyer role, similarly when searching for buyers the agent is in a seller role.\n",
    "6. `Agent_1` send a `search_service` request with the `query` previously generated.\n",
    "7. The OEF node returns a search result with the list of agent ids matching the `query`\n",
    "8. `Agent_1` finds `Agent_2`, so `Agent_1` sends a `CFP` to `Agent_2`, meaning that she wants to start a negotiation.\n",
    "The CFP contains a reference to the goods which Agent_1 is interested in and whether Agent_1 is a buyer or seller \n",
    "of these goods, both in the form of the query.\n",
    "9. `Agent_2` calls `get_proposals()` to generate a proposal for answering `Agent_1`\n",
    "10. `Agent_2` replies with a `Propose` message as an answer for the `CFP`.\n",
    "11. `Agent_1` sends an `Accept` message to `Agent_2`, meaning that she accepts the proposal.\n",
    "12. `Agent_1` sends a Transaction request to the `Controller`.\n",
    "13. `Agent_2` replies with a _matched accept_ to `Agent_1`, meaning that she confirms definitively the transaction. \n",
    "14. `Agent_2` sends a Transaction request to the `Controller` (analogous to step 12).\n",
    "15. The `Controller` notifies `Agent_1` that the transaction has been confirmed.\n",
