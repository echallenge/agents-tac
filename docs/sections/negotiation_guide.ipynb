    "4. Analogous to (2), but for `Agent_2`\n",
    "5. `Agent_1` calls `build_services_query(is_searching_for_sellers)` to generate a `query` for the OEF\n",
    "6. `Agent_1` send a `search_service` request with the `query` previously generated.\n",
    "7. The OEF node returns a search result with the list of agent ids matching the `query`\n",
    "8. `Agent_1` finds `Agent_2`, so `Agent_1` sends a `CFP` to `Agent_2`, meaning that she wants to start a negotiation.\n",
    "9. `Agent_2` calls `get_proposals()` to generate a proposal for answering `Agent_1`\n",
    "10. `Agent_2` replies with a `Propose` message as an answer for the `CFP`.\n",
    "11. `Agent_1` sends an `Accept` message to `Agent_2`, meaning that she accepts the proposal.\n",
    "12. `Agent_1` sends a Transaction request to the `Controller`.\n",
    "13. `Agent_2` replies with a _matched accept_ to `Agent_1`, meaning that she confirms definitively the transaction. \n",
