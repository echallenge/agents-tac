    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will see how the agent state is managed in our framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The big picture\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following diagram gives you a high-level understanding of how the agent state management works for a generic negotiation.\n",
    "\n",
    ".. mermaid:: ../diagrams/agent-state-management-guide/summary.mmd\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see step by step what happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Agent_1` sends a `CFP` to `Agent_2`, meaning that she wants to start a negotiation. The CFP contains a reference to the goods which `Agent_1` is interested in and whether `Agent_1` is a buyer or seller  of these goods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Assuming `Agent_2` does not decline the CFP, `Agent_2` calls `get_proposals()` to generate a list of proposal for answering to `Agent_1`. When generating the proposals `Agent_2` applies all locked transactions - we discuss below when a transaction becomes locked - to the current agent state to generate a \"forward looking agent state\" (i.e. the state the agent will be in when all locked transactions have been settled by the `Controller`). This ensures `Agent_2` takes into account all the transactions she has committed to.\n",
    "3. `Agent_2` calls `store_proposals()` to store the proposals as `pending_proposals`.\n",
    "4. `Agent_2` replies with a `Propose` message which includes the proposals as an answer to the `CFP` (note, currently the list of proposals includes exactly one proposal).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `Agent_1` translates the proposal into a transaction and calls `is_profitable_transaction()` to identify whether the transaction is profitable.\n",
    "6. Assuming the proposal is profitable, `Agent_1` calls `add_locked_tx()` to add the transaction to the list of locked transactions.\n",
    "7. `Agent_1` calls `add_pending_initial_acceptance()` to add the transaction to the list of pending initial acceptances. This helps the agent identify whether an incoming `Accept` from `Agent_2` is a matching accept or an initial accept.\n",
    "8. `Agent_1` sends an `Accept` message to `Agent_2`, meaning that she accepts the proposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. `Agent_2` calls `pop_pending_proposal()` to recover the proposal -  in the form of a transaction - made to `Agent_1` and referenced in the acceptance message.\n",
    "10. `Agent_2` calls `is_profitable_transaction()` to identify whether the transaction is profitable. This proposal was created by `Agent_2`, however in the meanwhile `Agent_2` might have a different agent state which could render this proposal no longer profitable.\n",
    "11. Assuming the proposal is still profitable, `Agent_2` calls `add_locked_tx()` to add the transaction to the list of locked transactions.\n",
    "12. `Agent_2` sends an `Accept` message to `Agent_1`, meaning that she \"match-accepts\" the proposal.\n",
    "13. `Agent_2` sends a Transaction request to the `Controller`.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. `Agent_1` calls `pop_pending_initial_acceptance()` to \n",
    "15. `Agent_1` sends a Transaction request to the `Controller` (analogous to step 13).\n",
    "\n",
    "16. The `Controller` notifies `Agent_1` that the transaction has been confirmed.\n",
    "17. `Agent_1` calls `pop_locked_tx()` to remove the transaction from the locked transaction list.\n",
    "18. `Agent_1` calls `agent_state.update()` to update its state.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. The `Controller` notifies `Agent_2` that the transaction has been confirmed.\n",
    "20. `Agent_2` calls `pop_locked_tx()` to remove the transaction from the locked transaction list (analogous to step 17).\n",
    "21. `Agent_2` calls `agent_state.update()` to update its state (analogous to step 18)."
